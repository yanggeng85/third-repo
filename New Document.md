## aim ##



- to know how to solve Beauty-contest Game


- to understand Level-k method



- for equations in our solution we have to use Latex to obtain the final results
# Question 1 #
Consider the following two-person p-Beauty Contest game. Both players simultaneously choose a number between 0 and 100. Both players have their own target value: p1 and p2, respectively. The player whose number is closest to pi times the average of the two numbers wins a fixed price(e.g., 10 Eurocent). Suppose p1=0.7 and p2=1.5

Call the numbers that the players choose x1 and x2, respectively. Writh down the inequality that needs to hold for player 1 to win the price.
$|0.7(x_1+x_2)/2-x_1|<|1.5(x_1+x_2)/2-x_2|)$
