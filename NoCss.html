<li><p>for equations in our solution we have to use Latex to obtain the final results # Question 1 # Consider the following two-person p-Beauty Contest game. Both players simultaneously choose a number between 0 and 100. Both players have their own target value: p1 and p2, respectively. The player whose number is closest to pi times the average of the two numbers wins a fixed price(e.g., 10 Eurocent). Suppose p1=0.7 and p2=1.5</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Call the numbers that the players choose x1 and x2, respectively. Writh down the inequality that needs to hold for player 1 to win the price. <span class="math inline">|0.7(<em>x</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>x</em><sub>2</sub>)/2 − <em>x</em><sub>1</sub>|&lt;|1.5(<em>x</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>x</em><sub>2</sub>)/2 − <em>x</em><sub>2</sub>|)</span></p>
